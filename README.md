<h1>ALS-Ice-Bucket-Challenge-Audios-Alignment</h1>

<p>This project is to align in time a whole bunch of ALS Ice Bucket Challenge audios. All audio tracks in the data have a mutual sentence that could be used for temporal alignment.</p>

<h1>Short Time Fourier Transform and Haar Transform</h1>

<p>All the audios are transformed by Haar Transform or Short Time Fourier Transform in advance for further processing. Haar transform is ued to smooth the signal in the cross correlation method and Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is used for transform the signal in time domain to frequency domain.</p>
